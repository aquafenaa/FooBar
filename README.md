# FooBar
This is the source code for a discord bot. It contains features that I think are useful, as well as features I find funny for my personal server. 
If you would like to add this bot to your own server, feel free! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please create a report [here](https://github.com/aquafenaa/FooBar/issues)

### Features
- [x] Voice Ping 
  - Sends a message in a given text channel if a user joins a specified voice channel
  - [ ] Message / Role tied to each channel

- [x] Heartboard
  - When a message receives enough reactions, it is captured as an embed and sent to a specified channel
- [ ] Hateboard
  - Like heartboard but negative, and with separate reactions
  - Perhaps just allow multiple heartboards, but that's harder
